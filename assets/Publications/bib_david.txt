abstract = { Federated Learning (FL) provides a privacypreserving framework for distributed model training in domains where data is both sensitive and decentralized. While attractive for applications such as autonomous driving and mobile edge computing, practical deployments are hampered by the heterogeneous compute capabilities of participating clients. Slower devices, often referred to as stragglers, delay synchronous rounds and distort the balance of contributions, ultimately hindering convergence. To address this challenge, we propose FedCompAvg, a compute-aware aggregation strategy that scales client updates to both their local data volume and computational capability. We extend the Flower framework to support semi-asynchronous client profiles with heterogeneous numbers of local epochs and design a Complete Pathological Partitioner to enforce full class coverage in non-IID splits. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 under IID, Dirichlet, and pathological partitioning show that FedCompAvg improves fairness and stability in highly heterogeneous environments. Our results highlight that no single aggregation method dominates across all conditions, with FedCompAvg improving performance in more compute-heterogenous environments. },
